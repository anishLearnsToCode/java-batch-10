## Day 3
### Topics Covered

### Sample Problems to Try
- WAP (Write a program) to a print the following pattern. User enters no of rows (rows)
````text
********
***  ***
**    **
*      *
        
*      *
**    **
***  ***
********
````

- WAP to print the following pattern. User will enter number of rows (`rows` >= 2). If user
enters `rows` < 2 then no pattern is printed. You can also add a second variable called
`columns` that takes how many stars `*` to print in the first and last line.
````text
********
*      *
*      *
*      *
*      *

````

- WAP to print the following pattern, User enters `rows`
````text
